# Fork migration numbering

This repository keeps the deployed custom migration IDs unchanged:

- PostgreSQL `000111`–`000115`: coding projects, folders, embeddings repair and workspace test runs.
- SQLite `000031`–`000033`: coding projects, folders and workspace test runs.

Starting with upstream v0.8.3, incoming official migrations are renumbered to avoid those historical IDs. PostgreSQL upstream IDs >= 111 use an offset of +5; SQLite upstream IDs >= 31 use an offset of +3. Keep the SQL and order of each upstream migration unchanged.

| Engine | Official v0.8.3 range | Fork range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PostgreSQL | 111–118 | 116–123 |
| SQLite | 31–36 | 34–39 |

An existing fork database at PostgreSQL 115 or SQLite 33 therefore runs all newly added release migrations. A fresh database runs both the custom schema and the release schema in order. Never rename the historical custom migrations, force an existing database back to an earlier version, or reset its migration table.

For later upstream merges, apply the same offsets to newly added upstream migrations and adjust exact filename references in tests. Check that each engine has exactly one up/down pair per migration ID. Test both a new database and an upgrade from the pre-0.8.3 fork schema before deployment.
